- **`telco-call-centre/development-standards/api_design_patterns.md`** - API development patterns
- **`telco-call-centre/development-standards/testing_strategy.md`** - Testing approaches and frameworks
- **`telco-call-centre/development-standards/secure_coding_checklist.md`** - Security requirements

## Agent Collaboration

### Primary Agents to Reference
- **`telco-call-centre/sub-agents/software-developer-agent.md`** - For implementation tasks
- **`telco-call-centre/sub-agents/solutions-architect-agent.md`** - For system design
- **`telco-call-centre/sub-agents/security-expert-agent.md`** - For security reviews
- **`telco-call-centre/sub-agents/QA-engineer-agent.md`** - For testing strategies

### Multi-Tool Awareness
Remember this project supports:
- **Tabnine** (primary user preference)
- **GitHub Copilot** (current tool)
- **Cursor, Codeium, JetBrains AI** (universal compatibility)

Always provide solutions that work across all tools and maintain vendor independence.

## Code Generation Patterns

### Python Development
```python
# Follow established patterns in the codebase
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any
import logging

class ComponentName:
    """Comprehensive docstring following project standards."""
    
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        # Implement proper error handling
        
    def process_data(self, input_data: str) -> Optional[str]:
        """Process data with proper validation and sanitization."""
        try:
            # Multi-layer validation and sanitization
            cleaned_data = self._sanitize_input(input_data)
            return self._process_safely(cleaned_data)
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"Processing failed: {e}")
            return None
```

### Security Considerations
- Always implement HTML sanitization for user inputs
- Use multi-layer defense approaches
- Follow the security patterns established in `streamlit_demo.py`
- Implement proper input validation and error handling

## Project Context Awareness

### Core Files Understanding
- **`enhanced_classifier.py`** - AI classification engine with Gemini integration
- **`streamlit_demo.py`** - Interactive demo with advanced HTML handling
- **`launch_demo.py`** - Demo launcher with port management
- **`telco-call-centre/`** - Agent system with universal AI tool metadata

### Current Technical Patterns
- Multi-layer HTML sanitization (BeautifulSoup + regex + JavaScript)
- Auto-expanding panels with mathematical height estimation
- Iframe isolation for secure component rendering
- Type hints and comprehensive error handling throughout

## Usage Instructions

### For Code Implementation
```
Implement [FEATURE] following telco-call-centre/development-standards/coding_styleguide.md and using the patterns established in [RELEVANT_FILE].
```

### For Architecture Design
```
Design [SYSTEM/COMPONENT] architecture referencing telco-call-centre/sub-agents/solutions-architect-agent.md specializations and following our architectural principles.
```

### For Security Review
```
Review [CODE/COMPONENT] for security compliance following telco-call-centre/development-standards/secure_coding_checklist.md requirements.
```

Always maintain the project's commitment to universal AI tool compatibility while leveraging GitHub Copilot's specific capabilities.
