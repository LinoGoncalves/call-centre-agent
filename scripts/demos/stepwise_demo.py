🔄 Pipeline Visualization Demo - Stepwise Routing Intelligence
=============================================================

This script demonstrates the enhanced Streamlit interface with step-by-step
routing pipeline visualization showing:

1. Rules Engine evaluation and pattern matching
2. Vector DB similarity search with Pinecone integration  
3. RAG/LLM analysis with Gemini reasoning
4. Cost optimization and efficiency metrics
5. Complete decision transparency

Usage:
    python stepwise_demo.py

Features Demonstrated:
- ✅ Interactive pipeline step visualization
- ✅ Cost/performance optimization analysis
- ✅ Rules engine vs Vector DB vs LLM routing
- ✅ Real-time decision transparency
- ✅ Professional HTML rendering with rich styling
