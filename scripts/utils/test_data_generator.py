ðŸ“Š Mock Test Data for Rules Engine + RAG Pipeline Validation
===========================================================

This dataset contains comprehensive test cases that validate both:
1. Rules Engine: High-confidence pattern matches (85%+ confidence)
2. RAG System: Complex scenarios requiring LLM reasoning and context

Data Structure:
- rules_engine_tests: Tickets that should trigger specific rules
- rag_system_tests: Complex tickets requiring LLM analysis
- edge_cases: Borderline scenarios to test thresholds
- performance_tests: High-volume data for benchmarking

Usage:
    from test_data_generator import MockDataGenerator
    generator = MockDataGenerator()
    data = generator.generate_comprehensive_test_set()
