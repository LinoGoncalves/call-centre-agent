# Project Context (2025)

## Overview
This document summarizes the current state of the call centre agent project, including standards, agentic architecture, and recent updates for continuity and onboarding.

---

## 1. Standards Coverage
- All files in `telco-call-centre/development-standards/` are now fully populated with 2025 best-practice content for AI/ML, LLM, vector DB, MLOps, Streamlit, FastAPI, and agentic multi-tool workflows.
- Standards include: API design, security, MLOps, SRE, data pipelines, network, documentation, requirements, agile ceremonies, and more.

## 2. Agentic Architecture
- Multi-agent system with universal YAML metadata for all agent personas
- Master agent orchestration and specialized sub-agents for business, data, ML, security, cloud, QA, and more
- Universal AI tool compatibility (Tabnine, Copilot, Cursor, Codeium, JetBrains AI)

## 3. Compliance & Security
- All standards align with POPIA, GDPR, and industry best practices
- Security policies, network controls, and data residency are enforced across all workflows

## 4. Recent Updates
- Populated all previously blank standards files (see commit history)
- Ensured all documentation is up-to-date and tool-agnostic
- Lint warnings (markdown formatting) are present but do not affect content completeness

## 5. Next Steps
- Continue with agent development, multi-tool validation, and framework documentation
- Reference this file for onboarding, audits, and future standards updates
