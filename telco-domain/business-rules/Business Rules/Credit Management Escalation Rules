1. Dispute (Billing Dispute)
A dispute is a formal challenge where the customer asserts that a specific charge, fee, or the entire bill is incorrect, unauthorized, or violates the agreed-upon terms of service.

Key Characteristics of a Dispute:

Contesting the Validity: The customer explicitly states they believe a charge is wrong and should be removed or corrected.

Requires Investigation: The agent typically cannot resolve the issue on the spot with standard information and must initiate an investigation, which may involve:

Reviewing service records (e.g., usage logs, contract terms).

Involving specialized teams (e.g., billing integrity, fraud, or collections).

Placing the disputed amount on hold to prevent further collection action or service interruption.

Common Examples:

Unauthorized Charges: A charge for a premium service, third-party content, or equipment the customer claims they never ordered or authorized.

Incorrect Pricing/Discounts: The bill does not reflect an agreed-upon promotional rate, discount, or package price.

Double Billing: The customer was charged twice for the same service or equipment.

Service Not Received/Used: A charge for services that were unavailable, defective, or not delivered (e.g., being billed for a service during an extended outage).

Post-Cancellation Charges: Being billed for service after confirmation of cancellation.

2. General Billing Inquiry
A general billing inquiry is a request for clarification, explanation, or general information about the charges on a bill, but the customer has not yet formally rejected the charge's validity.

Key Characteristics of a General Inquiry:

Seeking Understanding: The customer is confused, surprised, or simply wants an explanation for a specific charge or the total amount.

Resolved by Explanation: The issue can typically be resolved quickly by the agent providing a clear, itemized explanation of the bill components.

Common Examples:

"My bill is higher than last month, why?" (The agent can explain an annual price adjustment, a one-time late fee, or a change in usage.)

Understanding Usage: Asking for details on data overage, international call charges, or a breakdown of a shared family plan's usage.

Clarification of Fees: Asking what a specific line item like a "regulatory recovery fee" or "administrative charge" means.

Payment Status: Asking if a payment was received, or what the due date is.

Requesting a Copy: Asking for a duplicate bill or a more detailed statement.

The Overlap
It's important to note that a general inquiry can quickly escalate into a dispute. For example:
