# MLOps Pipeline Standards (2025)

## Overview

This document defines MLOps pipeline standards for AI/ML, LLM, and vector DB workloads, supporting automation, compliance, and multi-agent orchestration.

---

## 1. Pipeline Architecture
- Modular, reusable pipeline components (data, training, evaluation, deployment)
- Support for hybrid (batch/real-time) workflows
- Use workflow orchestration tools (e.g., Kubeflow, MLflow, Airflow)

## 2. Automation & CI/CD
- Automate testing, validation, and deployment
- Use version control for code, data, and models
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)

## 3. Monitoring & Observability
- Monitor data drift, model performance, and resource usage
- Log all pipeline runs and agent actions
- Alert on anomalies and failures

## 4. Compliance & Security
- Enforce data residency, audit logging, and access control
- Mask or encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest
- Document all pipeline changes and approvals
