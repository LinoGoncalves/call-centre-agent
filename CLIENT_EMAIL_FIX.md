Subject: URGENT: Docker PostgreSQL Image Fix - Quick Solution Available

Hi [Client Name],

I understand you're experiencing a PostgreSQL image download error during the Docker setup. This is a common issue related to Docker Hub connectivity.

**QUICK FIX (2 minutes):**

1. Download the fix script: `fix-postgres-error.bat`
2. Run it from your command prompt in the project folder
3. The script automatically resolves the postgres:15-alpine issue

**What the fix does:**
- Tests alternative PostgreSQL images (postgres:15, postgres:14-alpine, postgres:13-alpine)
- Creates a working docker-compose file with the available image
- Starts your services automatically

**Files included:**
- `fix-postgres-error.bat` - Automated fix script
- `docker-compose-postgres-alternatives.yml` - Backup configurations
- `DOCKER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Detailed troubleshooting guide

**If the automated fix doesn't work:**
This indicates a network/firewall issue blocking Docker Hub access. Please:
1. Check corporate firewall settings
2. Verify Docker Hub access from your network
3. Contact your IT department about Docker registry access

The security-hardened environment remains fully intact - we're only changing the PostgreSQL base image to resolve the download issue.

Let me know if you need any assistance with the fix!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
