# üìö Call Centre AI Agent ‚Äî Onboarding & Tutorial Index

This README is the single-page onboarding and map for the tutorial series. It gets a new contributor from zero to a runnable demo, explains the architecture and the agentic framework used by the project, and points to the deeper phase tutorials.

Key goals:
- Give a clear mental model of the system and responsibilities
- Provide an actionable quick start that finishes with a working demo
- Point to the canonical agentic-framework docs and contribution process

Recommended reading order for a new engineer:
1. `docs/tutorial/PHASE_0_AGENTIC_FRAMEWORK.md` (this project's master orchestrator + sub-agent rules)
2. `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` (how the repo is laid out)
3. `COMPREHENSIVE_BUILD_TUTORIAL.md` (high-level walkthrough)
4. Phase tutorials (1 ‚Üí 6) as needed

## What this project is (one line)
Hybrid ML + LLM ticket classifier with an agentic orchestration layer and a production-ready Streamlit demo for telco call centre routing and triage.

## High-level architecture (quick)

Streamlit UI ‚Üí Orchestrator / Enhanced Classifier ‚Üí (Traditional ML | Gemini LLM)

- UI: `src/ui/streamlit_demo.py` ‚Äî interactive demo used in the Phase 4 tutorial
- Orchestrator: `src/enhanced_classifier.py` (or equivalent) ‚Äî fuses model outputs, applies business rules and fallbacks
- Traditional ML: `src/models/` ‚Äî scikit-learn pipelines for fast, local predictions
- Gemini LLM integration: wrapper module around Google generative APIs

Key documents:
- `docs/tutorial/PHASE_0_AGENTIC_FRAMEWORK.md` ‚Äî master orchestrator and sub-agent patterns (must-read)
- `agentic-framework/` ‚Äî sub-agent persona files, standards, templates
- `telco-domain/` ‚Äî business rules and project brief
- `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` ‚Äî file layout and conventions
- `COMPREHENSIVE_BUILD_TUTORIAL.md` ‚Äî consolidated build tutorial and rationale

---

## Quick start ‚Äî get a demo running (10‚Äì30 minutes)

1. Clone and enter the repo:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/LinoGoncalves/call-centre-agent.git
cd call-centre-agent
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file with required API keys. At minimum:

```text
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

4. Run unit tests to verify environment:

```powershell
pytest -q
```

5. Launch the demo (Streamlit):

```powershell
python launch_demo.py
# or directly
python -m streamlit run src/ui/streamlit_demo.py --server.port=8501
```

If the Streamlit server fails to start, check the venv activation, port conflicts, and the `.env` keys.

## Agentic framework: where to look and how to contribute

Core locations:
- `agentic-framework/sub-agents/` ‚Äî persona markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- `agentic-framework/standards/` ‚Äî coding, security, testing standards
- `.github/chatmodes/agent-orchestrator.md` ‚Äî canonical orchestrator behavior (single source of truth)
- `agentic-framework/agent-roster.json` ‚Äî mapping between task types and agents

If you need to add or change an agent:
1. Create or edit `agentic-framework/sub-agents/<name>-agent.md` following the YAML frontmatter convention.
2. Add the agent to `agent-roster.json` with routing rules.
3. Update `agentic-framework/CHANGELOG.md` with a short note.
4. Optionally add a template under `agentic-framework/templates/` for repeatable prompts.

Security and HITL policy:
- High-risk changes must require explicit human approval. See the HITL prompts in Phase 0.
- Agents must never auto-merge PRs that touch security-sensitive code.

## Key files you should open now

- `src/ui/streamlit_demo.py` ‚Äî Streamlit demo used for Phase 4
- `src/enhanced_classifier.py` or `src/models/` ‚Äî classifier and fusion logic
- `docs/tutorial/PHASE_0_AGENTIC_FRAMEWORK.md` ‚Äî orchestrator rules and prompt examples
- `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` ‚Äî project layout and contribution steps
- `telco-domain/project-brief.md` ‚Äî business context and acceptance criteria

---

## Minimal contributor checklist (first PR)

1. Pick a small issue or documentation task.
2. Fork and create a branch: `feature/<short-desc>`
3. Add tests or docs for your change.
4. Update YAML frontmatter if changing agent behavior.
5. Open a PR and request review from the relevant agent owner(s).

---

## Troubleshooting tips

- Tests failing? Run `pytest -q` and read the first failing trace. Many tests expect `.env` keys to be present.
- Streamlit not starting? Kill lingering python processes and check the port.
- LLM errors? Check `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and quota/region restrictions.

---

## After you‚Äôre set up ‚Äî suggested first tasks

1. Read `PHASE_0_AGENTIC_FRAMEWORK.md` and run through the quick copy-ready prompts.
2. Run the demo and send test tickets through the UI.
3. Explore `src/enhanced_classifier.py` to see fusion logic and where to add experiments.
4. Propose a small experiment in an issue and use the `data-scientist-agent` prompt recipe to scope it.

---

If you want, I can now:
- create `agentic-framework/templates/` files from the Phase 0 snippets, or
- open a PR with this README change and link reviewers, or
- run a quick markdown-lint pass and fix cosmetic warnings.
