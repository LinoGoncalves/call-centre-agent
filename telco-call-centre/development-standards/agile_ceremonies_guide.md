# Agile Ceremonies Guide (2025)

## Overview

This guide defines agile ceremonies tailored for AI/ML, LLM, and agentic multi-tool projects. It supports distributed, hybrid, and multi-agent teams.

## 1. Sprint Planning
- Define sprint goals, backlog items, and agent responsibilities
- Include LLM/vector DB integration and compliance tasks
- Use estimation techniques (story points, t-shirt sizing)

## 2. Daily Standup
- 15-minute sync for blockers, progress, and agent handoffs
- Include updates from automated agents and human team members

## 3. Backlog Refinement
- Review, clarify, and prioritize backlog items
- Ensure technical debt, compliance, and data residency are addressed

## 4. Sprint Review
- Demo completed features (AI/ML, LLM, vector DB, agentic workflows)
- Collect feedback from stakeholders and agents

## 5. Sprint Retrospective
- Reflect on process, tools, and agent collaboration
- Identify improvements for next sprint

## 6. Release Planning (Optional)
- Plan major releases, compliance milestones, and cross-team dependencies

## 7. Multi-Agent Syncs
- Schedule regular syncs for agent personas (e.g., security, data, ML, cloud)
- Use shared documentation and universal standards
