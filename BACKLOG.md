✅ ACTUAL Department: technical_support_l2
⏱️ Resolution Time: 6.5h
😊 Customer Satisfaction: 8.2/10
🎯 First Contact Resolution: No
🔄 Escalation Path: l1_tech → l2_network → field_tech

```python
top_match = vector_db.query(ticket_embedding, top_k=1)
if top_match.score >= 0.92 and top_match.historical_accuracy >= 0.85:
    return top_match.classification  # Cache hit
