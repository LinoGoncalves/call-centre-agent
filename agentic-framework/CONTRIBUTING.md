### Adding New Agents

When creating a new specialized agent:

1. **Follow the YAML Metadata Schema**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   agent_type: "specialized"
   specialization: "Your Specialization"
   tools_compatible: ["tabnine", "github_copilot", "cursor", "codeium", "jetbrains_ai"]
   context_scope: "local"  # or "global"
   interaction_patterns: ["step_by_step", "approval_checkpoints"]
   model_suggestions:
     optimal: ["o1-mini", "claude-3.5-sonnet"]
     acceptable: ["gpt-4", "gemini-pro"]
   oversight_mode: "HITL"
   ---
   ```

2. **Structure Your Agent File**:
   - Clear role definition
   - Cognitive triggers (when to engage this agent)
   - Key responsibilities
   - Source of truth references (to standards/)
   - Deliverable format specifications
   - Quality criteria

3. **Maintain Tool Agnosticism**:
   - Avoid tool-specific syntax
   - Focus on universal AI interaction patterns
   - Test with multiple AI coding assistants

4. **Update Registry**:
   - Add your agent to `agent-roster.json`
   - Include all required metadata fields

### Adding New Standards

When contributing new development standards:

1. **Ensure Universal Applicability**:
   - Not tied to specific technologies
   - Applicable across domains
   - Industry best practices

2. **Clear Documentation**:
   - Purpose and scope
   - When to apply
   - Examples and anti-patterns
   - Related standards

3. **Consistency**:
   - Follow existing standard formats
   - Use clear section headings
   - Include practical examples

### Pull Request Process

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**:
   - Follow existing code/documentation style
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add/update tests if applicable

4. **Test Your Changes**:
   - Verify with multiple AI tools if possible
   - Ensure no broken references
   - Check markdown rendering

5. **Commit with Clear Messages**:

### YAML Frontmatter
- Always include all required fields
- Use consistent formatting
- Add comments for complex configurations

### Documentation
- Write for clarity
- Include examples
- Explain "why" not just "what"
- Keep it tool-agnostic
