# SRE Handbook (2025)

## Overview

This handbook defines Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) best practices for AI/ML, LLM, and agentic systems, supporting reliability, observability, and compliance.

---

## 1. Reliability Engineering
- Define and monitor SLOs, SLIs, and SLAs for all services
- Use error budgets to balance innovation and stability
- Automate incident response and escalation

## 2. Observability
- Implement centralized logging, metrics, and tracing
- Use distributed tracing for agentic workflows
- Monitor model drift, data quality, and pipeline health

## 3. Incident Management
- Maintain an incident response plan and runbooks
- Conduct blameless postmortems and root cause analysis
- Document all incidents and lessons learned

## 4. Automation & Tooling
- Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for repeatable environments
- Automate testing, deployment, and rollback
- Integrate with CI/CD and monitoring tools
