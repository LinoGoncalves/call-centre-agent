# Security Policies (2025)

## Overview

This document defines security policies for AI/ML, LLM, vector database, and cloud-native systems. All policies align with POPIA, GDPR, and industry best practices, and are compatible with multi-agent, multi-tool environments.

---

## 1. Access Control

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum access required for each agent, user, or service.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Enforce RBAC for all APIs, databases, and admin interfaces.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for all privileged accounts and admin actions.
- **Agent Context**: Log and validate agent identity for all automated actions.

---

## 2. Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit & At Rest**: Use TLS 1.3+ for all network traffic; encrypt all sensitive data at rest (AES-256 or better).
- **PII/PHI Masking**: Mask or redact personally identifiable and health information in logs, responses, and analytics.
- **Data Residency**: Enforce data residency and sovereignty requirements for all regulated data.
- **Secure Backups**: Encrypt and regularly test backups; store in separate, access-controlled locations.

---

## 3. Application Security

- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user and agent inputs (see secure_coding_checklist.md).
- **Output Sanitization**: Sanitize all outputs, especially those rendered in UIs or consumed by downstream agents.
- **Dependency Management**: Use only approved libraries (see approved_libraries.json); monitor for CVEs.
- **API Security**: Enforce OAuth2/JWT, rate limiting, and CORS on all endpoints.

---

## 4. LLM & Vector DB Security

- **Prompt Injection Defense**: Apply prompt sanitization and context window controls for all LLM endpoints.
- **Model Isolation**: Run LLMs/vector DBs in isolated containers or VMs; restrict network access.
- **Audit Trails**: Log all LLM/vector DB queries and responses with agent/user context.
- **Inference Policy**: Restrict LLM access to sensitive data; require explicit consent for data use in training or inference.

---

## 5. Monitoring & Incident Response

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Use SIEM and anomaly detection for all critical systems.
- **Alerting**: Configure real-time alerts for suspicious activity, failed logins, and privilege escalations.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Maintain and regularly test an incident response plan; document all incidents.
- **Forensics**: Preserve logs and evidence for all security incidents; support regulatory investigations.

---

## 6. Compliance & Training

- **Regulatory Alignment**: Map all controls to POPIA, GDPR, and relevant standards (ISO 27001, NIST).
- **Security Awareness**: Require annual security training for all staff and agents.
- **Third-Party Risk**: Assess and monitor all vendors, open-source models, and cloud providers for compliance.
