## Purpose
Define a universal tagging standard for all resources (cloud, on-prem, data, ML/LLM/vector DB) to support cost management, security, compliance, and operational efficiency.

---

## Tagging Scope
- Applies to all cloud and on-prem resources (compute, storage, networking, AI/ML, vector DB, data pipelines, etc.)
- Applies to all environments (dev, test, staging, prod)
- Applies to all ML/LLM models, datasets, and experiment artifacts

## Tagging Best Practices
- Tags must be applied at resource creation via IaC or automation
- Tags must be immutable for compliance and audit purposes
- Tag values must be standardized (use enums or controlled vocabularies where possible)
- Tags must be validated in CI/CD pipelines and IaC modules
- Tagging policy must be reviewed annually or when new resource types are introduced

---

## Tagging for ML/LLM & Data Assets
- All models, datasets, and experiment artifacts must be tagged with `Project`, `Owner`, `Environment`, `MLModel`, and `DataResidency`
- Use `Confidential` for any asset containing PII or sensitive data
- Tag experiment runs and artifacts in MLflow, DVC, or similar tools

---

## Compliance & Auditing
- Tagging compliance must be monitored via cloud policies and automated audits
- All exceptions must be documented and approved by the compliance team
