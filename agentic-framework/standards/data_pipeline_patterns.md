# Data Pipeline Patterns (2025)

## Overview

This document defines best-practice data pipeline patterns for AI/ML, LLM, and vector database workloads, supporting compliance, scalability, and multi-agent orchestration.

---

## 1. Ingestion Patterns
- Batch, streaming, and hybrid ingestion
- Support for structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
- Use schema validation and data quality checks at source

## 2. Transformation Patterns
- Use modular, reusable transformation steps (ETL/ELT)
- Support for feature engineering, anonymization, and enrichment
- Apply data lineage and audit logging

## 3. Storage Patterns
- Separate raw, curated, and feature stores
- Use vector DBs for embeddings and similarity search
- Enforce encryption and data residency

## 4. Orchestration Patterns
- Use workflow engines (e.g., Airflow, Prefect) for scheduling
- Support agent-triggered and event-driven pipelines
- Implement retries, alerting, and monitoring

## 5. Serving Patterns
- Serve data to LLMs, APIs, dashboards, and agents
- Support batch and real-time serving
- Apply access control and output sanitization
