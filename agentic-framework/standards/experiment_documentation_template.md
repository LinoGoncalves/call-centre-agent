## Example: Sports Prediction Experiment (Superbru EPL)

### 1. Experiment Metadata
- **Title:** Rival Pick Prediction Model (Logistic Regression)
- **Experiment ID:** SPB-EXP-001
- **Date:** 2025-01-15 to 2025-01-20
- **Owner:** Superbru Strategy Team
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
- **Related Project:** Superbru EPL 2025 Prediction System

---

### 2. Objective
**Hypothesis**: Rival picks in Superbru EPL prediction pools can be predicted from fixture odds and rival position with >60% accuracy using logistic regression.

**Research Question**: Can we use market odds (Pinnacle) and rival competitive position to predict whether a rival will bank the favorite or go contrarian?

**Business Goal**: Improve pool concentration estimates to optimize Protect/Chase mode decisions (retain lead vs maximize EV).

---

### 3. Background & Motivation
**Context**: Current pool concentration estimates rely on risk profile heuristics (Conservative rivals = 80% follow odds). No empirical validation exists.

**Prior Work**: 
- Risk profile framework (rivals-profile.md) defines 3 categories: Conservative, Balanced, High-Variance
- Heuristic accuracy unknown (labeled ⚠️ HEURISTIC in prediction-strategist.md)

**Why This Matters**: 
- Accurate pool estimates improve EV calculations (+0.5 to +1.5 pts/round improvement)
- Reduce false contrarian plays when pool is 50-50 (not 60-40 as estimated)
- Enable data-driven Protect/Chase thresholds (currently ±3 pts heuristic)

---

### 4. Experimental Design

**Dataset**: 
- **Source**: Superbru historical pick data (rounds R01-R20, 2024-2025 season)
- **Size**: 500 samples (25 rivals × 20 rounds)
- **Features**: 
  - `odds_favorite` (Pinnacle closing odds for favorite, continuous)
  - `rival_position_delta` (rival points behind leader, integer)
  - `fixture_importance` (gameweek number / 38, continuous 0-1)
- **Target**: `picked_favorite` (binary: 1 = rival picked favorite, 0 = rival picked underdog/draw)

**Model**:
- **Type**: Logistic Regression (scikit-learn 1.3.0)
- **Parameters**: L2 regularization (C=1.0), max_iter=1000, solver='lbfgs'
- **Baseline**: Majority class classifier (always predict "pick favorite") = 68% accuracy

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correct predictions (target: >60%)
- **Log-loss**: Probabilistic calibration (lower = better calibrated)
- **F1-score**: Balance precision/recall for minority class (contrarian picks)
- **Confusion Matrix**: False positives vs false negatives

**Compliance/Security**: 
- Data scraped from public Superbru leaderboard (no personal information)
- No GDPR concerns (public competition data)

---

### 5. Procedure (Code Snippets)

```python
# Step 1: Data Collection
python scripts/scrape_rival_picks.py --rounds R01-R20

# Step 2: Feature Engineering
df['odds_favorite'] = df.apply(lambda x: min(x['odds_home'], x['odds_away']), axis=1)
df['picked_favorite'] = (df['pick'] == df['favorite']).astype(int)

# Step 3: Train-Test Split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, stratify=df['rival_id'])

# Step 4: Model Training
model = LogisticRegression(C=1.0, max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)  # Result: 78%
```

### 6. Results

| Metric | Baseline | Test Set | Out-of-Sample (R21-R25) |
|--------|----------|----------|-------------------------|
| Accuracy | 68% | 78% | 74% |
| Log-loss | N/A | 0.42 | 0.51 |
| F1-score | 0.00 | 0.76 | 0.71 |

**Key Findings**:
1. ✅ Hypothesis SUPPORTED: 78% accuracy (exceeds 60% target)
2. **Feature Importance**: Odds (-1.42) > Fixture importance (+0.35) > Position (+0.08)
3. **Out-of-Sample**: 74% accuracy on R21-R25 confirms generalization
4. **Statistical Significance**: p < 0.01, 95% CI [68%, 88%]

---

### 7. Analysis & Discussion

**Interpretation**: Rivals heavily follow market odds (coefficient -1.42). Late-season risk aversion detected (coefficient +0.35).

**Limitations**:
- Small sample (500 samples, need 1,000+)
- Only 3 features (could add rival risk profile, form)
- Class imbalance (68% favorite, 32% contrarian)

**Next Steps**: Expand dataset, add features, test Random Forest/XGBoost, deploy to production.

---

### 8. Conclusion

✅ **SUPPORTED** - Rival picks predictable with 78% accuracy (exceeds target).

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Replace heuristic pool estimation with ✅ IMPLEMENTED model
2. Integrate `rival_predictor.py` into next-round-picks workflow
3. Monitor out-of-sample accuracy monthly, retrain if degradation >5%
