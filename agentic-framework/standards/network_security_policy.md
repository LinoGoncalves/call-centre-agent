# Network Security Policy (2025)

## Overview

This document defines network security policies for AI/ML, LLM, and agentic systems, supporting compliance, zero trust, and multi-agent environments.

---

## 1. Zero Trust Principles
- Enforce least privilege and explicit access for all agents and services
- Use network segmentation and micro-segmentation
- Require mutual TLS for all internal service communication

## 2. Perimeter Security
- Restrict inbound/outbound traffic with firewalls and security groups
- Use DDoS protection and rate limiting
- Monitor and alert on suspicious activity

## 3. Internal Network Controls
- Isolate sensitive workloads (LLMs, vector DBs) in private subnets
- Use private endpoints for data stores and APIs
- Enforce network policies for agent-to-agent and agent-to-service traffic

## 4. Compliance & Monitoring
- Log all network access and changes
- Retain logs for regulatory compliance (POPIA, GDPR)
- Regularly test network controls and incident response
