## Domain Application Examples

### Sports Prediction System: Technical Leadership & ADRs

**Example: Architecture Decision Record (ADR) - Honesty Principle**

```markdown
# ADR-005: Embed Honesty Principle in All Prediction Features

**Status:** ‚úÖ ACCEPTED  
**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Deciders:** Principal Engineer, Product Owner, Security Expert

## Context

Sports prediction system uses mix of implementation approaches:
- ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: Odds fetching, EV calculation (validated)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC: Pool estimation (pattern-based, 60% ¬±20% accuracy - NOT validated)
- ‚ùå PLANNED: ML predictions (not yet implemented)

**Problem:** Users cannot distinguish validated features from heuristic assumptions.

## Decision

ALL prediction features MUST display implementation status (‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå) to users.

**Rationale:**
1. **User Trust:** Transparency builds credibility vs over-promising
2. **Legal Risk:** Heuristic claims without disclaimers = potential liability
3. **Technical Debt:** Forces honest assessment of what's truly validated
4. **Product Quality:** Prevents shipping ‚ùå PLANNED features prematurely

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Backend API (Week 1-2)
```python
# All API responses include implementation_status field
@app.route('/api/v1/pool/estimate')
def pool_estimate():
    return {
        "estimate": 0.65,
        "implementation_status": "‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC",
        "accuracy_claim": "60% ¬±20%",
        "validation_status": "UNVALIDATED"
    }
```

### Phase 2: Frontend UI (Week 3)
```jsx
// React component displays honesty badge
<HonestyBadge status="‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC" 
               accuracy="60% ¬±20%" 
               tooltip="Pattern-based estimate, not validated by ML" />
```

### Phase 3: CI/CD Enforcement (Week 4)
```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow fails if honesty labels missing
- name: Validate Honesty Labels
  run: python scripts/check_honesty_labels.py || exit 1
```

### Phase 4: Monitoring (Week 5)
```python
# Prometheus alert if responses missing labels
if label_display_rate < 100:
    trigger_critical_alert("Honesty SLO violated")
```

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- User trust increases (transparent about limitations)
- Prevents over-promising (forces honest accuracy claims)
- Blocks premature ‚ùå PLANNED feature deployment

**Negative:**
- Initial development overhead (~2 weeks)
- May reduce perceived "sophistication" (admitting heuristics)

**Mitigation:**
- Frame ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC as "rapid prototyping" (positive spin)
- Show roadmap: v1.0 Heuristic ‚Üí v2.0 ML (builds anticipation)

## Compliance

- **Security Policy:** ‚úÖ Aligns (honest disclosure reduces liability)
- **Architectural Principles:** ‚úÖ Aligns (transparency, user-centric design)
- **Engineering Standards:** ‚úÖ New standard (honesty-first principle)

## Validation

**Definition of Done:**
- [ ] All API endpoints return implementation_status field
- [ ] UI displays honesty badges on ALL predictions
- [ ] CI/CD blocks deployments missing honesty labels
- [ ] Prometheus monitors honesty SLO (100% label display)
- [ ] Documentation updated (API spec, user guide)
```

**Example: Technical Strategy - Heuristic vs ML Decision**

```markdown
# Technical Strategy: When to Use Heuristics vs ML

## Guiding Principle
**Honesty First:** Better to ship ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC with honest uncertainty than wait 6 months for ‚úÖ VALIDATED ML.

## Decision Matrix

| Feature | Complexity | Data Availability | User Impact | Approach | Status |
|---------|-----------|------------------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Pool estimation | Medium | Limited (50 samples) | Medium | ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC | Ship with ¬±20% uncertainty |
| Rival profiling | Low | Good (200+ games) | High | ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC | Ship with manual validation |
| ML predictions | High | Insufficient | Low | ‚ùå PLANNED | Wait for 1000+ samples |
| EV calculation | Low | N/A (formula-based) | High | ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED | Closed-form math |

## Heuristic Fast-Track Criteria

Ship ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC if:
1. ‚úÖ Accuracy claim is HONEST (e.g., "60% ¬±20%" not "95% accuracy")
2. ‚úÖ Uncertainty displayed prominently
3. ‚úÖ User impact limited (decision support, not automated betting)
4. ‚úÖ Can iterate quickly based on feedback

Block ‚ùå PLANNED features until:
1. Sufficient training data (min 1000 samples)
2. Validation framework in place (backtesting, cross-validation)
3. Performance meets minimum threshold (>65% accuracy)

## Engineering Culture Shift

**Old mindset:** "Don't ship until it's perfect ML"  
**New mindset:** "Ship ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC with honest labels, iterate to ‚úÖ VALIDATED"

**Benefits:**
- Faster user feedback loops
- Honest about current capabilities
- Prevents analysis paralysis
```

### Telecommunications: Technical Leadership

**Example: ADR for Call Center System Scalability**

```markdown
# ADR-012: Horizontal Scaling for Call Center Dashboard

**Status:** ACCEPTED  
**Context:** Call volume spikes during outages  
**Decision:** Use Kubernetes horizontal pod autoscaling  
**Implementation:** Deploy to AKS with HPA rules
```

---

### Honesty-First Principle for Principal Engineering

**1. Architecture Decision Records with Honesty Assessment**

Every ADR includes implementation status section:

```markdown
## Implementation Status Assessment

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED: [Features with validation]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC: [Features with assumptions, uncertainty]
- ‚ùå PLANNED: [Features not yet built]

**Honesty Compliance:**
- [ ] All ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC features display uncertainty
- [ ] No ‚ùå PLANNED features exposed to users
- [ ] API responses include implementation_status field
```

**2. Technical Debt Register with Honesty Context**

Tag tech debt by honesty impact:

```markdown
# Technical Debt Register

| ID | Description | Honesty Impact | Priority |
|----|-------------|---------------|----------|
| TD-001 | Pool estimator uses patterns not ML | ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH (users see HEURISTIC label) | P1 |
| TD-002 | No backtest validation framework | ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL (can't validate claims) | P0 |
| TD-003 | UI performance slow | ‚úÖ LOW (no honesty impact) | P2 |
```

**3. Engineering Standards for Honesty**

Establish honesty as architectural principle:

```markdown
# Architectural Principle: Honesty-First Development

**Principle:** All features MUST declare implementation status (‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå)

**Rationale:**
- Builds user trust through transparency
- Prevents over-promising (forces honest accuracy claims)
- Enables incremental delivery (‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC ‚Üí ‚úÖ VALIDATED)

**Enforcement:**
- CI/CD blocks deployments missing honesty labels
- Code reviews check for implementation_status fields
- Quarterly honesty audits (all features tagged ‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå)
```

**4. Mentoring Junior Engineers on Honesty**

```markdown
# Engineering Mentorship: Honesty in Code

**Lesson:** "It's OK to ship ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC if you're honest about it"

**Bad Example:**
```python
def predict_outcome():
    # Uses simple pattern matching
    return {"prediction": "HOME_WIN", "confidence": 0.95}  # ‚ùå DISHONEST
```

**Good Example:**
```python
def predict_outcome():
    # Uses simple pattern matching
    return {
        "prediction": "HOME_WIN",
        "confidence": 0.60,
        "implementation_status": "‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC",
        "accuracy_claim": "60% ¬±20% (NOT validated by ML)",
        "uncertainty": "¬±20%"
    }  # ‚úÖ HONEST
```

**Coaching Point:** "Your reputation as an engineer = honesty about your code's limitations"
```

**5. Strategic Planning with Honesty Roadmap**

```markdown
# Product Roadmap: Honesty Evolution

**Q1 2025:** Ship v1.0 (‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC)
- Pool estimation (pattern-based, 60% ¬±20%)
- Honest labels throughout UI
- User feedback collection

**Q2 2025:** Iterate to v2.0 (‚úÖ VALIDATED ML)
- Train ML model on Q1 user feedback data
- Backtest on 1000+ historical games
- Upgrade to ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED (accuracy >65%)

**Q3 2025:** Scale (‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED)
- Remove ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC labels (no longer needed)
- Production ML serving
- Monitor for drift
```

**Principal Engineer Honesty Checklist:**

- [ ] All ADRs include implementation status assessment (‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è/‚ùå)
- [ ] Technical debt register tracks honesty impact (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- [ ] Architectural principles embed honesty-first development
- [ ] Engineering mentorship teaches honesty in code
- [ ] Product roadmap shows honesty evolution (‚ö†Ô∏è ‚Üí ‚úÖ)
