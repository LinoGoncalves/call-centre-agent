## Domain Application Examples

### Sports Prediction Pools (e.g., Superbru EPL)

**Test Plan - Pool Concentration Estimator**:

**User Story**: US-002 Pool Concentration Estimation Display

**Test Objective**: Verify pool estimation logic correctness and honesty label display

**Test Cases**:

**TC-001: Conservative Rivals Follow Favorite (Positive Test)**
```
Preconditions:
- System configured with 3 rivals (all Conservative risk profile)
- Fixture odds: Liverpool 1.60, Draw 4.20, Brentford 6.00

Steps:
1. Navigate to Round 08 fixture list
2. Locate Liverpool vs Brentford fixture
3. Hover over fixture to display pool concentration tooltip

Expected Results:
- Pool estimation shows "~60-80% Liverpool" (Conservative rivals follow favorite)
- Honesty label displays: "‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC (Pattern-based, NOT data-driven)"
- Uncertainty range displays: "¬±20%"
- Tooltip explains logic: "Conservative rivals (100%) ‚Üí 80% pick favorite"

Actual Results: [To be filled during test execution]

Pass/Fail: [To be marked]

Priority: HIGH (core functionality)
Traceability: US-002, AC-001
```

**TC-002: High-Variance Rivals Go Contrarian (Positive Test)**
```
Preconditions:
- System configured with 3 rivals (all High-Variance risk profile)
- Fixture odds: Liverpool 1.60, Draw 4.20, Brentford 6.00

Steps:
1. Navigate to Round 08 fixture list
2. Hover over Liverpool vs Brentford

Expected Results:
- Pool estimation shows "~30-50% Liverpool" (High-Variance go contrarian)
- Honesty label still displays "‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC"
- Uncertainty range: "¬±20%"

Priority: HIGH
Traceability: US-002, AC-002
```

**TC-003: Missing Honesty Label (Negative Test)**
```
Objective: Verify honesty label MUST display (catch false statistical claims)

Preconditions:
- Pool estimator configured
- Honesty label accidentally removed in UI (test failure scenario)

Steps:
1. Navigate to fixture
2. Hover over pool concentration

Expected Results:
- ‚ùå TEST SHOULD FAIL if honesty label missing
- Bug should be filed: "CRITICAL: Missing ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC label - violates honesty principle"

Priority: CRITICAL (prevent dishonest claims)
Traceability: Honesty-First Principle, documentation_styleguide.md Section 5
```

**TC-004: Uncertainty Range Validation (Boundary Test)**
```
Objective: Test uncertainty range calculation

Test Data:
| Rival Mix | Expected Pool Liverpool | Uncertainty |
|-----------|-------------------------|-------------|
| 100% Conservative | 80% | ¬±20% (60-100%) |
| 50% Conservative, 50% High-Variance | 55% | ¬±20% (35-75%) |
| 100% High-Variance | 30% | ¬±20% (10-50%) |

Steps:
1. For each rival mix, configure system
2. Check pool estimate
3. Verify uncertainty range displayed

Expected: Uncertainty always ¬±20% (heuristic has WIDE range)

Priority: MEDIUM
Traceability: US-002, AC-004
```

**Bug Report Template - Pool Estimator**:

```
BUG-042: Pool Concentration Claims "Precise 60.3%" (Violates Honesty Principle)

Severity: CRITICAL (False statistical claim)

Environment: 
- Version: v1.0.2
- Browser: Chrome 120
- OS: Windows 11

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to Round 08 fixtures
2. Hover over Liverpool vs Brentford
3. Observe pool concentration display

Expected Behavior:
- Pool should display "~60% ¬±20%" (WIDE range, acknowledges uncertainty)
- Honesty label "‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC" should be visible

Actual Behavior:
- Pool displays "60.3% Liverpool" (FALSE PRECISION)
- NO honesty label
- NO uncertainty range

Impact:
- Violates honesty-first principle (documentation_styleguide.md Section 5)
- Misleads user into believing high precision (heuristic only 60% ¬±20% accurate)
- Could damage user trust if predictions fail

Root Cause (Suspected):
- UI developer used toFixed(1) instead of displaying range
- Honesty label component not rendered

Suggested Fix:
1. Change display from "60.3%" to "~60% ¬±20%"
2. Add honesty label component: "‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC (Pattern-based)"
3. Add tooltip explaining uncertainty
4. Add automated test TC-003 (catch missing labels in future)

Priority: P0 (blocks release - violates core principle)

```
Preconditions:
- Queue threshold set to 10 calls
- Monitoring active

Steps:
1. Add 11 calls to queue
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Check alert triggered

Expected: SMS/email alert sent to manager within 30 seconds

Priority: HIGH
```

## Honesty-First Principle (For All Domains)

**When writing test cases, ALWAYS**:

1. ‚úÖ **Test honesty labels are present**:
   ```
   Test Case: Verify Capability Labels Display
   
   Expected:
   - ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED features show green checkmark
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC features show yellow warning + "Pattern-based, NOT data-driven"
   - ‚ùå PLANNED features show red X + "Roadmap Phase 3 - not yet built"
   
   Failure Condition: If ANY feature missing label ‚Üí CRITICAL BUG
   ```

2. ‚úÖ **Test uncertainty quantification**:
   ```
   Test Case: Uncertainty Range Validation
   
   Given: Pool estimator is HEURISTIC (not trained model)
   When: Displaying pool concentration
   Then: Uncertainty MUST be ¬±20% (not precise 60.3%)
   And: Tooltip MUST explain "WIDE uncertainty range"
   ```

3. ‚úÖ **Create negative tests for false claims**:
   ```
   Test Case: Detect False Statistical Claims (Negative Test)
   
   Scenario: Developer accidentally claims "ML model" when it's heuristic
   
   Test Data (Invalid):
   - UI displays: "Our neural network predicts 95% accuracy"
   - Code comment: "Uses Monte Carlo simulation"
   - Actual implementation: Simple if-else heuristic
   
   Expected: Automated honesty checker flags violations
   - Scan for keywords: "neural network", "Monte Carlo", "model predicts"
   - Cross-reference with implementation status (‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC)
   - If mismatch ‚Üí Fail build, file CRITICAL bug
   ```

4. ‚úÖ **Include validation data requirements in test data**:
   ```
   Test Data Requirements (For Future ML Model Tests):
   
   To test Logistic Regression Pool Predictor (Phase 3):
   - Need ‚â•500 rival pick samples (currently 0 - can't test yet)
   - Need train-test split (80-20)
   - Need validation metric: accuracy ‚â•60%, log-loss <0.5
   
   Current Status: ‚ùå CANNOT TEST (no training data available)
   Workaround: Test heuristic version (‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC) instead
   ```

5. ‚úÖ **Test edge cases for honesty violations**:
   ```
   Edge Case Tests:
   
   EC-001: What if user removes honesty label from UI?
   ‚Üí TEST: Automated accessibility scan should detect missing labels
   ‚Üí FAIL if label not found
   
   EC-002: What if developer hardcodes "95% accuracy" in tooltip?
   ‚Üí TEST: Regex scan code for numeric accuracy claims without validation
   ‚Üí FAIL if claim lacks citation (e.g., "test accuracy 78%" with link to experiment doc)
   
   EC-003: What if model status changes (‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC ‚Üí ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED)?
   ‚Üí TEST: Verify all labels updated (UI, docs, code comments)
   ‚Üí FAIL if inconsistency found (e.g., UI says ‚úÖ but code says ‚ö†Ô∏è)
   ```

**QA Honesty Checklist**:
- [ ] All test cases verify capability labels (‚úÖ / ‚ö†Ô∏è / ‚ùå) display correctly
- [ ] Negative tests catch false statistical claims (missing labels, false precision)
- [ ] Uncertainty ranges validated (¬±20% for heuristics, confidence intervals for models)
- [ ] Test data requirements documented (can't test ML models without training data)
- [ ] Automated honesty checks integrated (scan for keyword violations)
