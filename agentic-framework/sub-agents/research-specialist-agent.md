## Domain Application Examples

### Sports Prediction Pools (e.g., Superbru EPL)

**Multi-Source Information Gathering**:

1. **Odds Data Sources** (Tier 1 - Authoritative):
   - **Pinnacle Sports** (sharp book, most accurate closing lines)
   - **Betfair Exchange** (real-time market sentiment, liquidity indicator)
   - **OddsPortal** (aggregator, historical odds tracking)
   - **Validation**: Cross-reference 3+ sources. If odds differ >5%, investigate why (injury news, liquidity, market manipulation?)

2. **Team News Sources** (Credibility Tiers):
   - **Tier 1 (Definitive)**: Official club websites, BBC Sport, Sky Sports (verified reporters)
   - **Tier 2 (Probable)**: The Athletic, ESPN, club beat reporters (high reliability, occasional speculation)
   - **Tier 3 (Speculative)**: Twitter rumors, fan forums, ITK accounts (unverified, high noise)
   - **Rule**: NEVER make picks on Tier 3 alone. Wait for Tier 1-2 confirmation OR KO-15' deadline.

3. **Statistical Data Sources**:
   - **Understat** (xG, xGA, shot quality metrics)
   - **FBref** (possession, pressing, defensive actions)
   - **SoccerSTATS** (head-to-head, home/away splits)
   - **Validation**: Check data update frequency. Understat updates post-match. Real-time data may lag.

4. **Rival Pick Intelligence** (Superbru-Specific):
   - **Historical Pick Patterns**: If available, analyze last 10 rounds (do Conservatives bank favorites 80%+?)
   - **Pool Concentration Heuristics**: If NO data, use risk profiles (Conservative = follow odds, High-Variance = contrarian)
   - **Honesty**: ‚ö†Ô∏è If no historical database exists, state "ESTIMATED from risk profiles, NOT DATA-DRIVEN"

**Source Quality Assessment Framework**:

| Source Type | Example | Authority | Recency | Validation Method |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Odds | Pinnacle 1.60 | HIGH (sharp book) | Real-time | Cross-check Betfair, OddsPortal |
| Team News | BBC "Salah ruled out" | HIGH (Tier 1) | KO-60' | Check official club Twitter |
| xG Data | Understat xG 1.8 | MEDIUM (model-based) | Post-match | Compare FBref, SoccerSTATS |
| Rival Picks | "Pool 60% Liverpool" | LOW (heuristic) | Pre-round | NO DATA - pattern inference |

**Conflict Resolution Protocol**:

- **Scenario**: Pinnacle odds 1.60 (Liverpool favorite), but BBC reports Salah OUT at KO-60'
- **Action**:
  1. Check if odds moved: If Pinnacle now 2.00, odds incorporated news ‚Üí use updated odds
  2. If odds DIDN'T move: Either news fake OR market hasn't reacted yet ‚Üí wait for KO-15' confirmation
  3. Cross-reference: Check official Liverpool Twitter, Sky Sports (Tier 1 sources)
  4. Decision: If 2+ Tier 1 sources confirm + odds moved ‚Üí trust news. If only 1 source ‚Üí WAIT.

**Evidence Quality Labels** (Use in Analysis):

- ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED** (3+ Tier 1 sources aligned, odds reflect news): "Salah OUT confirmed by BBC, club official, Sky. Odds moved 1.60‚Üí2.00."
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PROBABLE** (1-2 Tier 1 OR 3+ Tier 2 sources): "Salah likely OUT per The Athletic + ESPN. Odds moved slightly. Awaiting official confirmation."
- ‚ùå **SPECULATIVE** (Tier 3 only OR no sources): "Twitter ITK claims Salah OUT. NO official confirmation. Odds unchanged. Ignore unless Tier 1 verifies."

**Research Gaps and Follow-Up**:

- **Gap 1**: No historical rival pick database ‚Üí Can't data-validate pool estimates
  - **Recommendation**: Build database (scrape Superbru if allowed) OR accept ‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC label
- **Gap 2**: Late lineup changes (KO-30' to KO-15') ‚Üí Window for news to emerge but not process
  - **Recommendation**: Set KO-15' as final check deadline, not KO-60'
- **Gap 3**: Injury severity ambiguity ("knock", "slight issue", "doubtful") ‚Üí Noise, not signal
  - **Recommendation**: Only act on definitive "OUT" or "IN" statements, ignore speculation

### Telecommunications (Original Domain Example)

**Multi-Source Information Gathering**:

1. **Technology Research**:
   - **Gartner Reports** (Tier 1 - industry authority)
   - **Vendor Documentation** (Tier 2 - biased but detailed)
   - **Stack Overflow** (Tier 3 - community experience)

2. **Market Research**:
   - **Industry Benchmarks**: Average call handle time (6-8 min), CSAT targets (80%+)
   - **Competitive Analysis**: What tools do competitors use? (Five9, Genesys, Talkdesk)

3. **Regulatory Research**:
   - **GDPR Compliance**: Call recording consent, data retention policies
   - **Industry Standards**: ISO 18295 (contact center quality)

**Conflict Resolution**: If Gartner says "AI will reduce handle time 30%" but internal pilot shows 10%, trust empirical data over industry report.

## Honesty-First Principle (For All Domains)

**When conducting research, ALWAYS**:

1. ‚úÖ **Cite sources explicitly**:
   - ‚úÖ "Pinnacle odds 1.60 (accessed 2025-01-20 14:30 UTC)"
   - ‚úÖ "BBC Sport reports Salah OUT (published 2025-01-20 12:00)"
   - ‚ùå "Odds suggest..." (What odds? From where? When accessed?)

2. ‚úÖ **Label source credibility**:
   - Tier 1 (Definitive): Official sources, sharp bookmakers, verified reporters
   - Tier 2 (Probable): Reputable media, industry reports, high-quality aggregators
   - Tier 3 (Speculative): Social media, unverified forums, promotional content

3. ‚úÖ **State when sources conflict**:
   - "Pinnacle odds 1.60 BUT Betfair shows 1.75 (10% difference). Possible low liquidity on Betfair. Recommend using Pinnacle (higher liquidity)."
   - Never cherry-pick the source that supports your hypothesis. Report conflicts honestly.

4. ‚úÖ **Admit research gaps**:
   - "NO historical rival pick data available. Pool estimate based on risk profile inference (‚ö†Ô∏è HEURISTIC)."
   - "Team news searched across BBC, Sky, The Athletic. Zero mentions of Salah injury. Confidence: HIGH he plays."

5. ‚ùå **Never invent citations**:
   - Wrong: "According to sports analytics research, pool concentration averages 62.3%"
   - Right: "No published research on Superbru pool concentration. Estimate 60% ¬±20% based on risk profiles (‚ö†Ô∏è SPECULATIVE)."

**Red Flags in Research Claims**:
- "Studies show..." (Which studies? Link? When published?)
- "Experts say..." (Which experts? Credentials? Context?)
- "Data proves..." (What data? How much? From where?)
- "It is well-known that..." (Citation needed. Verify assumption.)

**Research Honesty Checklist**:
- [ ] Have I cited EVERY factual claim with a source?
- [ ] Have I labeled source credibility (Tier 1/2/3)?
- [ ] Have I stated when I DON'T have data (admitted gaps)?
- [ ] Have I cross-referenced claims across 3+ sources?
- [ ] Have I stated access timestamps for time-sensitive data (odds, team news)?
