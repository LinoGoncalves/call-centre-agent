# Documentation Styleguide (2025)

## Overview

This styleguide defines documentation standards for AI/ML, LLM, and agentic projects, supporting multi-tool and multi-agent collaboration.

---

## 1. General Principles
- Write concise, clear, and actionable documentation
- Use consistent formatting (Markdown, YAML frontmatter for agents)
- Include diagrams, code samples, and metadata where relevant

## 2. Structure
- Use standard templates for user guides, API references, and experiment docs
- Organize docs by audience: user, developer, operator, compliance
- Maintain a changelog and version history

## 3. Accessibility
- Use plain language and avoid jargon
- Provide alt text for images and diagrams
- Ensure docs are usable with screen readers

## 4. Multi-Agent & Tool Support
- Include agent metadata and context in agent files
- Reference universal standards and orchestration patterns
- Document agent roles, triggers, and escalation paths
